# RediSearch

Redisearch implements a search engine on top of Redis. It has lots of advanced features, like exact phrase matching and numeric filtering for text queries, that are nearly not possible or inefficient with mysql search queries.

Here you find a list of RediSearch features included in the plugin:

**Search**: Instantly find the content youâ€™re looking for. The first time.

**Scoring fields differently**: Give different score to different fields. For example higher score to product name and number than its description.

**Fuzzy Search**: Don't worry about visitors misspelling.

**Autosuggest**: Adds a suggestion string to an auto-complete suggestion dictionary.

**Synonyms**: RediSearch supports synonyms, that is searching for synonyms words defined by the synonym data structure.

And even more features will be added in upcoming versions soon.

Some planned features are:

*   WooCommerce support: RediSearch is a perfect choice for E-commerce websites.
*   Binary documents indexing: Searching through binary files like pdf, word, powerpoint and ...
*   Advanced search: Adding advanced search functionality.
